		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			You are strongly encouraged to use LATEX2" for the preparation of your cameraready
			manuscript together with the corresponding Springer class file llncs.cls.
			Only if you use LATEX2" can hyperlinks be generated in the online version of
			your manuscript.
		</p>
		<div class="footnote">			
			Please note that the LNCS Editorial assumes that all authors have used the western
			naming convention, with given names preceding surnames. This determines the
			structure of the names in the running heads and the author index.
		</div>
		<p>
			The LATEX source of this instruction file for LATEX users may be used as a template.
			This is located in the “authors” subdirectory in ftp://ftp.springer.de/
			pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/instruct/ and entitled typeinst.tex. There
			is a separate package for Word users. Kindly send the final and checked source
			and PDF files of your paper to the Contact Volume Editor. This is usually one
			of the organizers of the conference. You should make sure that the LATEX and
			the PDF files are identical and correct and that only one version of your paper
			is sent. It is not possible to update files at a later stage. Please note that we do
			not need the printed paper.
		</p>
		<p>
			We would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is not possible to
			modify a paper in any way, once it has been published. This applies to both the
			printed book and the online version of the publication. Every detail, including
			the order of the names of the authors, should be checked before the paper is sent
			to the Volume Editors.
		</p>
		<h3>Checking the PDF File</h3>
		<p>
			Kindly assure that the Contact Volume Editor is given the name and email
			address of the contact author for your paper. The Contact Volume Editor uses
			these details to compile a list for our production department at SPS in India.
			Once the files have been worked upon, SPS sends a copy of the final pdf of
			each paper to its contact author. The contact author is asked to check through
			the final pdf to make sure that no errors have crept in during the transfer or
			preparation of the files. This should not be seen as an opportunity to update or
			copyedit the papers, which is not possible due to time constraints. Only errors
			introduced during the preparation of the files will be corrected.
		</p>
		<p>
			This round of checking takes place about two weeks after the files have been
			sent to the Editorial by the Contact Volume Editor, i.e., roughly seven weeks
			before the start of the conference for conference proceedings, or seven weeks
			before the volume leaves the printer’s, for post-proceedings. If SPS does not
			receive a reply from a particular contact author, within the timeframe given,
			then it is presumed that the author has found no errors in the paper. The tight
			publication schedule of LNCS does not allow SPS to send reminders or search
			for alternative email addresses on the Internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some cases, it is the Contact Volume Editor that checks all the final pdfs.
			In such cases, the authors are not involved in the checking phase.
		</p>
		<h3>Additional Information Required by the Volume Editor</h3>
		<p>
			If you have more than one surname, please make sure that the Volume Editor
			knows how you are to be listed in the author index. 
		</p>
		<h3>Copyright Forms</h3>
		<p>
			The copyright form may be downloaded from the “For Authors” (Information for
			LNCS Authors) section of the LNCS Website: www.springer.com/lncs. Please
			send your signed copyright form to the Contact Volume Editor, either as a
			scanned pdf or by fax or by courier. One author may sign on behalf of all of the
			other authors of a particular paper. Digital signatures are acceptable.
		</p>
		<h2>Paper Preparation</h2>
		<p>	
			Springer provides you with a complete integrated LATEX document class (llncs.cls)
			for multi-author books such as those in the LNCS series. Papers not complying
			with the LNCS style will be reformatted. This can lead to an increase in the
			overall number of pages. We would therefore urge you not to squash your paper.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please always cancel any superfluous definitions that are not actually used
			in your text. If you do not, these may conflict with the definitions of the macro
			package, causing changes in the structure of the text and leading to numerous
			mistakes in the proofs.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you wonder what LATEX is and where it can be obtained, see the <i>“La-
			TeX project site”</i> (http://www.latex-project.org) and especially the webpage
			<i>“How to get it”</i> (http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html) respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you use LATEX together with our document class file, llncs.cls, your
			text is typeset automatically in Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts. Please
			do not change the preset fonts. If you have to use fonts other than the preset
			fonts, kindly submit these with your files.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please use the commands \label and \ref for cross-references and the commands
			\bibitem and \cite for references to the bibliography, to enable us to
			create hyperlinks at these places.
		</p>
		<p>
			For preparing your figures electronically and integrating them into your
			source file we recommend using the standard LATEX <i>graphics</i> or <i>graphicx</i> package.
			These provide the \includegraphics command. In general, please refrain
			from using the \special command.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember to submit any further style files and fonts you have used together
			with your source files.
		</p>
		<h4>Headings.</h4>
		<p class="heading">	
			 Headings should be capitalized (i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other
			words except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be set with an initial
			capital) and should, with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left. Words
			joined by a hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the first word can stand alone,
			the second word should be capitalized.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are some examples of headings: “Criteria to Disprove Context-Freeness
			of Collage Language”, “On Correcting the Intrusion of Tracing Non-deterministic
			Programs by Software”, “A User-Friendly and Extendable Data Distribution
			System”, “Multi-flip Networks: Parallelizing GenSAT”, “Self-determinations of
			Man”.
		</p>
		<h4>Lemmas, Propositions, and Theorems.</h4>
		<p class = "heading">
			 The numbers accorded to lemmas,
			propositions, and theorems, etc. should appear in consecutive order, starting
			with Lemma 1, and not, for example, with Lemma 11.
		</p>
		<h3>Figures</h3>
		<p>
			For LATEX users, we recommend using the graphics or graphicx package and the
			\includegraphics command.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please check that the lines in line drawings are not interrupted and are of
			a constant width. Grids and details within the figures must be clearly legible
			and may not be written one on top of the other. Line drawings should have
			a resolution of at least 800 dpi (preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures
			should have a height of 2 mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and
			should have a caption which should always be positioned <i>under</i> the figures, in
			contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear <i>above</i>
			the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in your source.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \centering
			declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins and
			typeset in 9-point type (Fig. 1 shows an example). The distance between text
			and figure is preset to be about 8 mm, the distance between figure and caption
			about 6 mm.
		</p>
		<p>
			To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable quality,
			we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as pronounced as
			possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with the
			print quality before you send the files.
		</p>
		<img src="./Pictures/springer01.png" alt="Figure 1."/>
		<div class="figCaption">
			One kernel at xs (<i>dotted kernel</i>) or two kernels at <i>xi</i> and <i>xj</i> (<i>left and right</i>)
			lead to the same summed estimate at xs. This shows a figure consisting of different
			types of lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in italics,
			in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.
		</div>	
		<p>
			Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid using optional
			location parameters like “[h]” for “here”.			
		</p>		
		<h5>Remark 1.</h5>	
		<p class = "heading">
			In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
			(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is prepared to cover
			the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored pictures accepted. Colored
			pictures are welcome in the electronic version free of charge. If you send colored
			figures that are to be printed in black and white, please make sure that they
			really are legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
			converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.
		</p>
		<h3>Formulas</h3>
		<p>
			Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate line (with an
			extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed expressions should be
			numbered for reference. The numbers should be consecutive within each section
			or within the contribution, with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the
			right margin – which is the default if you use the equation environment, e.g.,
		</p>
		<math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'><mrow><mi>ψ</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo>∫</mo><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></msubsup><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mrow><mo>(</mo><msubsup><mrow><mo>∧</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msubsup><mi>u</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><msup><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>*</mo></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mo>−</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>ⅆ</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>
		<div class="mathCaption"></div>
		<p>	
			Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary text but with
			a small space before the end punctuation mark.
		</p>
		<h3>Footnotes</h3>
		<p>
			The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text either
			directly after the word to be discussed or – in relation to a phrase or a sentence –
			following the punctuation sign (comma, semicolon, or period). Footnotes should
			appear at the bottom of the normal text area, with a line of about 2 cm set
			immediately above them.1
		</p>
		<div class="footnote">			
			The footnote numeral is set flush left and the text follows with the usual word spacing.
		</div>		
		<h3>Program Code</h3>
		<p>
		Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in typewrfont, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier. <br/><br/>
		<i>Example of a Computer Program</i>
		</p>
		<code>
			program Inflation (Output)<br/>
			&#160;{Assuming annual inflation rates of 7%, 8%, and 10%,... 
			&#160;years};<br/>
			&#160;const<br/>
			&#160;&#160;MaxYears = 10; <br/>
			&#160;var<br/>
			&#160;&#160;Year: 0..MaxYears;<br/> 
			&#160;&#160;Factor1, Factor2, Factor3: Real; <br/>
			&#160;begin <br/>
			&#160;&#160;Year := 0;<br/>
			&#160;&#160;Factor1 := 1.0; Factor2 := 1.0; Factor3 := 1.0;<br/> 
			&#160;&#160;WriteLn(’Year 7% 8% 10%’); WriteLn; <br/>
			&#160;repeat<br/>
			&#160;&#160;Year := Year + 1; <br/>
			&#160;&#160;Factor1 := Factor1 * 1.07;<br/>
			&#160;&#160;Factor2 := Factor2 * 1.08; <br/>
			&#160;&#160;Factor3 := Factor3 * 1.10; <br/>
			&#160;&#160;WriteLn(Year:5,Factor1:7:3,Factor2:7:3,Factor3:7:3) <br/>
			&#160;until Year = MaxYears<br/> 
			end.

		<h3>Citations</h3>
		<p>
			For citations in the text please use square brackets and consecutive numbers:
			<cite>Smi1981</cite>, <cite>May2006</cite>, <cite>Cza2001</cite> – provided automatically by LATEX’s \cite . . . \bibitem mechanism.
		</p>	
		<h3>Page Numbering and Running Heads</h3>
		<p>	
			There is no need to include page numbers. If your paper title is too long to serve
			as a running head, it will be shortened. Your suggestion as to how to shorten it
			would be most welcome.
		</p>
		<h2>LNCS Online</h2>
		<p>
			The online version of the volume will be available in LNCS Online. Members
			of institutes subscribing to the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series have
			access to all the pdfs of all the online publications. Non-subscribers can only read
			as far as the abstracts. If they try to go beyond this point, they are automatically
			asked, whether they would like to order the pdf, and are given instructions as
			to how to do so.	
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that, if your email address is given in your paper, it will also be
			included in the meta data of the online version.
		</p>
		<h2>BibTeX Entries</h2>
		<p>
			The correct BibTeX entries for the Lecture Notes in Computer Science volumes
			can be found at the following Website shortly after the publication of the book:
			http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/lncs.html
		</p>
		<p class = "heading">
			<b>Acknowledgments.</b> The heading should be treated as a subsubsection heading
			and should not be assigned a number.
		</p>
		<h2>The References Section</h2>
		<p>			
			In order to permit cross referencing within LNCS-Online, and eventually between
			different publishers and their online databases, LNCS will, from now on, be
			standardizing the format of the references. This new feature will increase the
			visibility of publications and facilitate academic research considerably. Please
			base your references on the examples below. References that don’t adhere to this
			style will be reformatted by Springer. You should therefore check your references
			thoroughly when you receive the final pdf of your paper. The reference section
			must be complete. You may not omit references. Instructions as to where to find
			a fuller version of the references are not permissible.
		</p>
		<p>
			We only accept references written using the latin alphabet. If the title of the
			book you are referring to is in Russian or Chinese, then please write (in Russian)
			or (in Chinese) at the end of the transcript or translation of the title.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following section shows a sample reference list with entries for journal
			articles <cite>Smi1981</cite>, an LNCS chapter <cite>May2006</cite>, a book <cite>Fos1999</cite>, proceedings without editors <cite>Cza2001</cite> and
			<cite>Fos2002</cite>, as well as a URL <cite>NCBI</cite>. Please note that proceedings published in LNCS are
			not cited with their full titles, but with their acronyms!
